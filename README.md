# Stock-cal
This project consists of two Python programs: Stock Profit Calculator and Financial Data Retrieval.

## Stock Profit Calculator
The goal is to implement a stock profit calculator using Python. It requires computing various financial metrics based on user input regarding a stock transaction.

### Example
```
Ticker Symbol: AAPL
Allotment: 100
Final Share Price: 110
Sell Commission: 15
Initial Share Price: 25
Buy Commission: 10
Capital Gain Tax Rate (%): 15

PROFIT REPORT:
Proceeds: $11,000.00
Cost: $3,796.25
Net Profit: $7,203.75
Return on Investment: 189.76%
Break-even price: $25.25
```

## Financial Data Retrieval
This involves Python networking programming by retrieving financial data using an API. The task is to fetch data related to a stock symbol and present it to the user.

### Example
```
Input:
Please enter a symbol: AAPL

Output:
Sat Mar 23 14:20:40 PDT 2024
